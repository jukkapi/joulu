Easy unix-like streams

- fluent i.e. more like nio than io: stream producer calls the consumer, not vice versa
- lowest level: byte array
- a unixish next level: "lines of bytes" so ignore encoding, just split by \n
- another next level: strings using given encoding
- alternative lines: from string stream, not byte stream
